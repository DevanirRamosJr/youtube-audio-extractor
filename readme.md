# YouTube Audio Extractor

Simple terminal Python application that downloads a youtube video with only the audio and 
converts it to mp3, using the thumb as cover.

There is also the possibility to convert only a part of the audio.

## How to Use:

First you need to download and install [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) or [libav](http://libav.org/).


For python, it is recommended to use a venv!

With or without venv, you simply need to do:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python audio_extractor.py
```

## Possible Future Features:

* Renaming the audio file;
* Edit audio tags.
